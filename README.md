# Python Projects for Testing Vulnerabilities with Bandit

Welcome to our repository! This repository contains a collection of Python projects and JSON files designed to test and analyze security vulnerabilities using the **Bandit** static analysis tool. It serves as a comprehensive resource for exploring common vulnerabilities and evaluating Bandit's detection capabilities.

## üìã Repository Contents

### 1. **Python Projects**
- A variety of Python scripts showcasing intentional vulnerabilities, such as:
  - Hardcoded secrets
  - SQL injection
  - Command injection
  - Insecure deserialization
  - Use of weak cryptographic algorithms
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

### 2. **JSON Files**
- Bandit output stored in JSON format designed for additional testing and analysis.
